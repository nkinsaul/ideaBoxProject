### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
- Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
- Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP
- We worked with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git/GitHub workflow

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

#### Wins
- We got through all 4 iterations
- We had good communication and maintained a positive work environment
- We navigated working together across multiple time zones

#### Challenges 
- We struggled with solving the search bar functionality and ended up collaborating/rubber ducking with another group to get through that step
- In the beginning we found it challenging to work in a larger group but we revisted our DTR and came up with a way to move forward that worked well for us
